## Project Overview
The PUF_RKESystem project implements a secure Remote Keyless Entry (RKE) System using Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs). This approach aims to enhance the security of wireless communication systems by exploiting the unique, unclonable nature of PUFs.

## Features
- Implementation of a PUF-based system for RKE.
- Scripts for simulation and analysis of the system.
- Demonstrates enhanced security in wireless communications.

## Getting Started
These instructions will help you get the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Additional Python libraries (list any specific libraries required)

### Installation
Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Augustine156/PUF_RKESystem.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
